Small jest practice exercises: 
-A capitalize function that takes a string and returns it with the first character capitalized.
-A reverseString function that takes a string and returns it reversed.
-A calculator object that contains functions for the basic operations: add, subtract, divide, and multiply. Each of these functions should take two numbers and return the correct calculation.
-A caesarCipher function that takes a string and a shift factor and returns it with each character “shifted”
-An analyzeArray function that takes an array of numbers and returns an object with the following properties: average, min, max, and length.

const object = analyzeArray([1,8,3,4,2,6]);

object == {
  average: 4,
  min: 1,
  max: 8,
  length: 6
};
